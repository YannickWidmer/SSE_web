# SSE Web 
This project is the Web side of the SSE Project. It consists of a webpage with an SQL database which provides also a connection to the Android app via Google Cloud Messaging(gcm).

It is now in a very early stade and is in no mean useable.

If used with wamp this folder should be in the folder 

www/


We try to use relative links and to be portable but nothing is garantied.

All information about the development and sketches of how the Web site should look at the end can be found in 

sse/project_docs/
