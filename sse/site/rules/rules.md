The SSE table top role-playing game is a project I have been working on for a long time. Let me try to explain what is the essence of this game by making comparison. In this game one needs all kind of dices this is an integral part of the rules. I am conscious that most role-playing games tried for simplicity to reduce the amount of dices used but it also tends to reduce the players possibilities. In this game I try to give the players some play ground in which they can elaborate strategies. I try to do so for fight scenes as well as in negotiations and navigation. 

Now by trying to do so the game got more and more complicated, such that errors of players became common and the time thinking about the rules distracted from the scenario. This is why I decided to create an app to reduce both these problems. The way it is this lead to new opportunities and the game became more and more complicated, such that there are some how two versions one which one could play without app and the full version which needs the app. I would like to mention that the rules became more compicated but not what players and masters need to know once everyone has the app.


#Rules

As in most Role Play Games(RPG) all kind of conflicts are resolved by dice rolls. There are different reason for a roll. The two main ones beeing test rolls and damage rolls. Additionally all kind of randomness can be represented by dice rolls. For example the content of a room, the color of a horse...
The further won't be explained in further details (mainly because there is nothing to say).
## Test rolls
Whenever a player innates an action which is not completely trivial the master should ask for a test roll. According to the test and the avatars attributes the player choses among the possible dice combinations and rolls them. He then adds up all the showing numbers and substract the malus given by the dice choice, the so obtained number is later called luck. The player then tells his luck. If the number is higher than the difficulty of the test the avatar succeded in what he intended and is able to go on, otherwise the action failed, this implies that unique use ingredients are destroyed, the avatar gets tyred, loses some time,... 

There is also the possibility for players to interact and hence to oppose their abilities. In this case both test their abilities and compare their luck. The avatar with the higher luck wins.
### Stats
A hero has a set of attributes, for those he has a number describing how good this attribute is. Typically the hole party has the same set of attributes but it might differ. Examples of attributes are speed, strength, intelligence,... the set might be adapted to the universe, for example in a steampunk world the attribute technology affinity could be part of this set which in a fantasy world is less suitable. The attributes decide what a hero can do. A hero without Magic as an attribute can not perform magic.
### Test

For a test there are specific attributes, usually two but might also be just one, and a number which represents the difficulty of the test. The sum of the values of the attributes, or in the case its just one twice its value, is called the skill of the hero. The higher the skill the better suited the hero is for this task. The hero then chooses dice for the Test. The sum of the dice maximum value should be at least the value of his skill, the rest is called overlap, and one die should be at least half the skill. 
The player then throws the dice and sums up the values and removes the overlap this value is called luck.
If the luck is more than the difficulty the test was successful.
###### Example
A thief of Hillfolk named Danrnon just arrived to the wall of a castle, since he didn't intend to announce his arrival he chooses to climb over the Wall to enter the castle. The master tells him that this will be a test of his strength and agility against a 10 since the wall is quite big. The player whos avatar is Danron looks on his sheet to see that his agility is a 10 and his strength an 8, this means that his skill for this task is 18. He decides to take two D10 and hence has an overlap of 2. He throws the dice one shows a 5 and the other a 9. So Danron has a luck of 14 - 2 = 12  against the difficulty 10. As a consequence Danron climbs up the wall and has a wonderful view over the castle.
##### Hard failure
In case of a testroll where at least one die shows a 1, the player has to reroll a D10, if it falls on the 1 he had a hard failure. In the case of a hard failure independent of the luck the test is failed furthermore there should be some nefast consequences. How drastic or funny these consequences are is up to the master. Danrnon tries to jump down the wall, his luck is 11 but that is not enough for he rolled a 1 and rerolls a one on a D10. The master decides that he broke his leg and awayts to see how this hero, suposed to save a princess in another city but who prefered to come here to steal from the king, will deal with a broken leg in the middle age.

### Long Tests

In case an action is more complicated or just takes more time a single test might not suffice to model it approprietly, for this reason the long tests are introduced. A long test is a sequence of tests. The master sets three numbers the chances, the difficulty and the counter. He then decides how he wants to present this to the players. The sequence of tests is for the same action and hence the master sets the attributes once and for all. Also the player choses his dice once for all trys. The player then performs a first test. If it is a success the counter is reduced by one, in any cases one of the chances is used. In case of a hard failure the counter is increased. An appropruate amount of time should then be waited before he can use his next chance, this is the time for other players to act. If the counter goes down to zero before all chances are used the avatar succeeds in his task otherwise he failed. 

Note that the chances can be set to infinity, one should just make sure that the amount of time lost is a punishement big enough.
## Talents

There are different kinds of talents a hero can have. But before we introduce talents we need the notion of a generic action. A hero climbing up a wall is performing an instance of the generic action climbing. Such a group of actions is called generic action or just action. Such actions should, up to very good reasons, allways be tested with the same attributes. To describe how avatars with the same attribute scores still might be better at performing some actions than others, the talents are introduced


 
1. The first kind of talent, the most common, is a luck modifier.
Those are talents which add a number for a specific action. As an example, 
a thief could have the talent creep, so whenever he wants to creep up to some one, which might be a 
good idea when he wants to steal from this same person, he first computes his skill throws the 
dice and then he adds the level of his creep talent to his luck.

2. The second kind is a bit weaker and only modifies the skill, those are also for specific tests but instead of the luck they  are added to the skill. 

3. The third kind allows some actions which otherwise are not possible to perform. An example would be lock picking. Not any hero can give a try to open a locked door. The talent has then no effect on the test.

4. The last kind is just everything else, such a talent is described accordingly.

Except for the third kind most talents have levels, higher levels give better modifiers.
